# MakeSVGIndex
(Personnal use) Utility to build an index with png files from a folder containing glyphs in SVG

The JSesh font libraries on [JSesh web site](https://jsesh.qenherkhopeshef.org/glyphs) are stored in zip files, with pre-rendered SVG signs for easy display.

This software is used to generate those files. It's probably not interesting unless you are in charge of the JSesh web site.


## TODO

- At some points, some deprecated methods will need to be replaced.
- if I feel like it, the code might be cleaned up. But really, it's java, but it could be shell script.
