# jseshUtils
Various small utilities I have made for JSesh (to be moved out from the main codebase)

This project will contain a number of independant softwares using the JSesh libraries. Their code was
initialy packaged with JSesh, but it's not very convenient: I occasionnaly forget where they are and what they do.

**No binary distribution of these utilities is planned,** so you will need to install Java to run them.
