# Normalize SVG

For some uses, the various sizes of the JSesh SVG fonts are not practical. We want a collection of SVG signs with a single scale.

This project allows to create one.

Please keep in mind it corresponds to a specific need of mine, and it's mostly a temporary fix.

It uses version `7.8.4-SNAPSHOT`, which is not published yet. So it won't compile right now.
